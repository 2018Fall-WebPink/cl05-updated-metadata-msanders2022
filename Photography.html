        <!--My experience with my phototgraphy-->
        <p> My doing of photography for a living is a major part of my life. Everything in my pictures tells a story, shows emotion, and shows the beauty in the world. </p>
        <p> What would you like to see in the world? Beauty? Joy? Sorrow? Suffering? Happiness? Anything in picture can me something that we would not expect. Just think about what story the picture is telling. Pictures capture the moments that matter most... History</p>
